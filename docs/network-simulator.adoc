== Simple workflow

. Define routers
. Define networks
. Define topology
. Call manager to connect networks via routers & CalcRoutes
. Call manager to process and set routes to routing tables

[id='defining-routers']
== Defining routers

The user only uses one constructor for the name of the router object.
Router objects must be stored in HashMap.

[id='defining-networks']
== Defining networks

When initializing networks, the following 3 main attributes must be set:

    * CIDR (int)
    * Network name (String)
    * Network IP address (String)

If the network serves as a corner gateway to the internet, the `Internet` attribute must be set to `true`.
Every router has a default gateway that targets the shortest path to internet network!
All networks must be stored in `ArrayList<Network>`.
[%hardbreaks]
For now, the entire topology is stored in Network objects.
There is one more attribute named CalcRoutes that points to a list of CalcRoute objects.
The list contains the description of topology (routes).

Each CalcRoute object has 2 attributes:

    * *NextHop object*
        ** Next hop router (object)
        ** Next hop network position in the networks ArrayList (int)

[%hardbreaks]
    * *Cost*
        ** If the networks are not directly connected, and have to be calculated, the cost must be equal to the networks ArrayList size{nbsp}+{nbsp}1
        ** If the target network is same as the source, the value of this attribute must be set to `null` in Java environments.

[id='initializing-networks-in-docker']
== Initializing networks in Docker

[%hardbreaks]
To initialize networks in Docker, the user must call the `NetworkManager` method named `connect` and specify the following 2 parameters:

	* `topology (ArrayList<Network>)`
	* `routers (HashMap<Router>)`

[source,java]
--
routers = networkManager.connect(topology, routers);
--

The method returns a HashMap of updated routers with added corresponding physical interfaces, their addresses and names:

[id='calculating routes']
== Calculating routes

For calculating routes is used *Floyd-Warshall* algorithm which basically works like distance vector algorithm implemented in routing protocols like RIP. Method need only topology table as argument.
[source,java]
--
routers = networkManager.calcRoutes(topology);
--
== Process routing table to routes
After calculating user needs process routing table with shortest paths to route format used in physical routing tables on routers and also for each calculated route must run method for finding physical next hop interface on router which match next hop networks network address. Path is parsed to iproute2 format. For processing there is only one method named processRoutes with 1 argument and it’s calculated topology table. Method return HashMap where key is router name and value is parsed route.
[source,java]
--
HashMap hashMap = networkManager.processRoutes(topology);
--
== Set routes to routers routing tables
For this action we are currently using python (flask) REST running on each router. Also there is Java controller for this REST. Controller use java.net package for requesting REST.
[source,java]
--
networkManager.setRoutes(hashMap, routers);
--
