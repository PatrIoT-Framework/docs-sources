[id='kubernetes-operator']
= Kubernetes operator for network simulation

The network simulation on top of Kubernete uses the operator to manage whole simulation. The Kubernetes operator is a software extension to Kubernetes that manages applications and their components.

The operator defines the following custom resources:

* **Network**  represents the simulated network.

* **Device** represents device deployed inside simulated network.

The goal of these custom resources is to provide interface to deploying applications and simulated network to the Kubernetes. This interface is used internally by the <<network-sim-kubernetes.adoc, network simulator>>.

== Prerequisites
The operator needs to be run on the Kubernetes with network plugin which supports NetworkPolicy. We recommend you use the Calico network plugin.
